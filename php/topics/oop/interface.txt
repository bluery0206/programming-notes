INTERFACE
    Same as the abstract, is a class that you cant instantiate

        $obj = new Obj(); // Will not work

    and only extend from it from a child class

        // REMEMBER: no `class` keyword, just `interface` then the name
        interface IntefaceClass { ... }

        class ClassicClasss implements IntefaceClass {...}


    It is also used to lay out all methods and function that the
    child class HAVE to implement if methods are laid out like this

        interface IntefaceClass {
            // It can also have attributes but only limited to constants
            // That also means that interfaces cant have `__construct()`
            const CONST_NAME = 'Value';

            // Interface class can only have public methods
            public function funcName(); // Must create in child class
        }

        class Child implements IntefaceClass {
            // attrs 
            // construct()

            public function funcName() {
                // code 
            }

            // other methods()
        }
