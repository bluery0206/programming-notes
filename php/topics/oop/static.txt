STATIC
    METHOD
        Static methods can be called directly
        without creating an instance of the class first.

            class ClassName {
                public static function funcOneName() { .. }
                public function funaTwoName() {
                    self::funcOneName();
                }
            }

            ClassName::funcName();
    
        WHEN TO USE
            When no class-related data are needed and
            the method is widely important enough to be 
            used by multiple classes or methods

                class Calculator {
                    public static function add(a, b) {
                        return a + b;
                    }
                }

                $sum = Calculator::add(1, 2);

            because static doesnt creates an instance, therfore
            dont have attributes initialized
    

    PROPERTY
        its essentially a global variable placed in a class 
        
            class ClassName {
                public static attrName = value;
            }

        Authors Note: I dont understand this enough to explain
