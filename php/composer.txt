Composer
	> Dependency management tool in PHP. 
	> Allows declarion of libraries that projects depends on
	> Manages (install/update) them automatically.

Basic Usage
	Importing Autoloader
		in random PHP file
			``` php
				require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'
			```

	in composer.json
		```
			{
			    "require": {
			        "monolog/monolog": "2.0.*"
			    }
			}
		```

		"require" tells composer which packages your proeject depends on

		The naming of packages follows this rule:
			`vendorName/packageName`

		launch your command line in the same directory and run 
		>>> composer install --no-dev

	Updating packages
		>>> composer update --no-dev

	Version Contraints
		2.0.* 	- all versions within 2.0
		>=2.0 	- more latest or 2.0
		<2.1 	- older versions


	Installing dependencies
		from composer.json
			>>> composer update

			// This will create the `vendor/` folder with files including 
			// the autoloader and a composer.lock just besides the json.

		from composer.lock
			>>> composer install

	Update
		>>> update
		or
		>>> update vendorName/pkgName [...]

	Packagist.org
		// Like the pypi.org of pip

	Every a project is a package
		composer.json
			{
				...
				"name": "vendorName/pkgName",
				...
			}
