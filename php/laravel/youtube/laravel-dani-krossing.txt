How to Set Up a Development Build
	"""
		Just to explain what I mean by "test server".:)

		When building our website, we want to have a "test build", that only we (the
		developer) can see, which isn't visible to anyone who visit our live website.

		Therefore, we need to have a "test version" that we develop in, and a "libe
		version" which viewers can see online. Both versions exists inside our 
		Laravel project at the same time, which is most likely different from how
		you have done things up until now...

		So essentially, the reason we do this, is so that we can develop on our
		website and once we are happy with the changes, we can then push the
		changes into the live version of our website.

		Pretty cool right! :)

	> Setting up testing server
		# Download Node.js

		on vite.config.js
			# ensure 
				input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js']

		on cmd
			>>> npm install vite --save-dev

			Running Server
				>>> npx vite
				or 
				>>> npm run dev


		# on pageName.blade.php
			<head>
				@vite('resources/css/app.css')
				@vite('resources/js/app.css')
			</head>

	> Pushing in the Live version
		on cmd
			>>> npx vite build

	# if there's `hot` file, just delete it


How to Use Get Type Routes
	# Where to create routes
		routes/


	# How to create a get route
		Four types
			Post type
			get type
			put type
			delete type

		# Get route example
		# route for home.blade.php
			Route::get("/", function () {
				return view("home");
			})

		# Parameters using routes
			Route::get("/portfolio/{firstname}/{lastname}", function ($firstname, $lastname) {
				return view("porfolio");
			})

		# Named routes
			Route::get("/test", function () {
				return "This is a test";
			})->name("testpage")

			on thisPage.blade.php
				# Traditional
					{{ url("/test") }}
				# The other way
					{{ route("testpage") }}


		# Grouped routes
			# Traditional/Manual
				Route::get("/portfolio/company", function () {
					return view("porfolio");
				});

				...

			$ The latter
				Route::prefix("portoflio")->group(function () {
					Route::get("company", function () {
						return view("company");
					});

					...
				});

How to Use Post Type Routes
	use Illuminate\Http\Request;

	Route::post("/formsubmitted", function (Request $request) {
		$request->validate([
			'fullname' => 'required|min:3|max:30',
			'email' => 'required|min:3|max:30|email',
		]);

		$fullname = $request->input("fullname");
		$email = $request->input("email");

		return "dasdlkaslda'
	})->name("formsubmitted")

	on home.blade.php
		form action="/formsubmitted" method="post"
			# cros-site request forgery (csrf) protection
			@csrf

			input something
		form

		{{ route("formsubmitted") }}


Create Layouts and @include to reuse views
	on resources/views/
		create layouts/
			create main.blade.php
				header
					@yield("header")
				header

				main
					#yield("maincontent")
				main

		home.bade.php
			@extends("layouts.fileName")

			@section('header')
				h2
				nav
					a
					...
					a
				nav

				@include("header")
			@endsection

			@section('maincontent')
				h2
				nav
					a
					...
					a
				nav
			@endsection

		@include('fileName') - literlly includes the fies
