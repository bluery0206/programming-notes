ABSTRACT CLASS
    A class that you can't instantiate
    
        $obj = new Obj(); // Will not work

    but only extend from it from a child class

        abstract class AbsClass { ... }

        class ClassicClasss extends AbsClass {...}


    It is also used to lay out all methods and function that the
    child class HAVE to implement if methods are laid out like this

        abstract class AbsClass {
            abstract function funcName(); // Must create in child class
        }

        class Child extends AbsClass {
            public function funcName() {
                // code 
            }
        }


    It can also have attributes (public, protected, and private)
    and the child class will automatically inherit it

        abstract class AbsName {
            private string $varName;
            protected string $varName;
            public string $varName;

            function __construct($args) {
                // code
            }

            // Abstract class cannot have private methods,
            // only protected and public
            abstract function funcName(); // Must create in child class

            // Is okay not to implement/overwrite because 
            // it is an already a functioning method
            protected function methName() {
                // code
            }
        }
