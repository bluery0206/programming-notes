NAMESPACE
    Are a way to group classes, interfaces, functions, and constants to 
    avoid name collisions between code components, especially when 
    integrating third-party libraries or large applications

        namespace MyProject; // Must be declared at the very top of the file

        class MyClass { ... }

    It can also have sub-namespaces

        namespace Person\Operator;

    USING NAMESPACED CLASS
        OPTION 1: FULL NAME
            $obj = new \Person\Operator();
        
        OPTION 2: IMPORT WITH `use`
            use Person\Operator;
            $obj = new Operator();

    You can also do alias
        use Person\Operator as OP;
        $obj = new OP();
