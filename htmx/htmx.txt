AJAX
The core of htmx is a set of attributes that allow you to issue AJAX requests directly from HTML:

Attribute	Description
hx-get		Issues a GET request to the given URL
hx-post		Issues a POST request to the given URL
hx-put		Issues a PUT request to the given URL
hx-patch	Issues a PATCH request to the given URL
hx-delete	Issues a DELETE request to the given URL


Triggering Requests
	input, textarea & select are triggered on the change event
	form is triggered on the submit event
	everything else is triggered by the click event

	hx-trigger="mouseenter once" // adding "once" makes it trigger duh once
	changed
	delay:<Ns or Nms interval>
	throttle:<Ns interval>
	load 
	revealed // when the dude scrolled into the shit
	every <interval> // fetches shit every Ns
	Load Polling = "After this element loads, wait X seconds, then reload itself"
		<div hx-get="/messages"
		    hx-trigger="load delay:1s"
		    hx-swap="outerHTML">
		</div>

		// Stops refresh 
		<?php
			$hasNewData = checkForNewData();

			if ($hasNewData) {
			    // Return element WITH hx-trigger (continue polling)
			    echo '<div hx-get="/data.php" hx-trigger="load delay:5s">New data here</div>';
			} else {
			    // Return element WITHOUT hx-trigger (stop polling)
			    echo '<div>No new data, polling stopped</div>';
			}
		?>


INDICATOR
	makes opacity:0 by default but when something happens, it will show it. It is usually used in spinners
	    <button hx-get="/click">
		    Click Me!
		    <img class="htmx-indicator" src="/spinner.gif" alt="Loading...">
		</button>
	While the htmx-indicator class uses opacity to hide and show the progress indicator, if you would prefer another mechanism you can create your own CSS transition like so:

	.htmx-indicator{ display:none; }
	.htmx-request .htmx-indicator{ display:inline; }
	.htmx-request.htmx-indicator{ display:inline; }

	If you want the htmx-request class added to a different element, you can use the hx-indicator attribute with a CSS selector to do so:

	<div>
	    <button hx-get="/click" hx-indicator="#indicator">
	        Click Me!
	    </button>
	    <img id="indicator" class="htmx-indicator" src="/spinner.gif" alt="Loading..."/>
	</div>


Swapping
	htmx offers a few different ways to swap the HTML returned into the DOM. By default, the content replaces the innerHTML of the target element. You can modify this by using the hx-swap attribute with any of the following values:

	Name	Description
	innerHTML
	the default, puts the content inside the target element
	outerHTML
	replaces the entire target element with the returned content
	afterbegin
	prepends the content before the first child inside the target
	beforebegin
	prepends the content before the target in the target’s parent element
	beforeend
	appends the content after the last child inside the target
	afterend
	appends the content after the target in the target’s parent element
	delete
	deletes the target element regardless of the response
	none
	does not append content from response (Out of Band Swaps and Response Headers will still be processed)


Synchronization
	Often you want to coordinate the requests between two elements. For example, you may want a request from one element to supersede the request of another element, or to wait until the other element’s request has finished.

	htmx offers a hx-sync attribute to help you accomplish this.

	Consider a race condition between a form submission and an individual input’s validation request in this HTML:

	<form hx-post="/store">
	    <input id="title" name="title" type="text"
	        hx-post="/validate"
	        hx-trigger="change">
	    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
	</form>
	Without using hx-sync, filling out the input and immediately submitting the form triggers two parallel requests to /validate and /store.

	Using hx-sync="closest form:abort" on the input will watch for requests on the form and abort the input’s request if a form request is present or starts while the input request is in flight:

	<form hx-post="/store">
	    <input id="title" name="title" type="text"
	        hx-post="/validate"
	        hx-trigger="change"
	        hx-sync="closest form:abort">
	    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
	</form>
	This resolves the synchronization between the two elements in a declarative way.

	htmx also supports a programmatic way to cancel requests: you can send the htmx:abort event to an element to cancel any in-flight requests:

	<button id="request-button" hx-post="/example">
	    Issue Request
	</button>
	<button onclick="htmx.trigger('#request-button', 'htmx:abort')">
	    Cancel Request
	</button>
	More examples and details can be found on the hx-sync attribute page.

	CSS Transitions


sync
	hx-sync="this:[abort|closest <element>:abort"
	hx-sync="element:[]"

	this:abort
	What it does: Cancels MY OWN previous request if I make a new one

	Example: Search box typing fast → only latest search runs

	Translation: "If I start again, stop my previous"

	#element:abort
	What it does: Cancels MY request if #element makes a request

	Example: Cancel validation if form submits

	Translation: "If THEY start, stop MINE"

	this:replace
	What it does: Replaces MY queued request with new one

	Example: Auto-save typing → only latest gets queued

	Translation: "Skip my old queued, use new"

	this:queue
	What it does: Makes MY requests wait in line

	Example: "Load more" button clicks → loads pages in order

	Translation: "Wait your turn"

	this:drop
	What it does: Ignores MY new trigger if I'm busy

	Example: Refresh button spam → only one request

	Translation: "Busy, try later"

Practical Examples Where OOB Rocks:
	1. Shopping Cart (Classic Use Case)
	html
	<!-- Add to cart button -->
	<button hx-post="/add-to-cart.php?id=123" hx-target="#product-info">
	  Add to Cart
	</button>

	<div id="product-info">Product details...</div>
	<div id="cart-count">Cart: 0 items</div>
	<div id="cart-total">Total: $0.00</div>

	<!-- add-to-cart.php returns: -->
	<div id="product-info">Added to cart!</div>

	<!-- OOB updates: -->
	<div id="cart-count" hx-swap-oob="true">Cart: 1 item</div>
	<div id="cart-total" hx-swap-oob="true">Total: $19.99</div>




hx-include="#store-id" 
 	includes the element preferably a form if the thing is outside it


hx-params
	- filter select only a few
		ie
			hx-params="item,qty"

		only include names item and qty

	- or exclude some with keyword not
		ie
			hx-params="not description"

		excludeds description

FILE UPLOAD
	<form
	  hx-post="/upload.php"
	  hx-encoding="multipart/form-data" // SHOULD BE PUT
	>
	  <input type="file" name="file">
	  <button>Upload</button>
	</form>

ADDING VALUES WITHOUT A FORM
	<button
	  hx-post="/add"
	  hx-vals='{"store_id": 12, "category": "drinks"}'
	>
		Add Item
	</button>
