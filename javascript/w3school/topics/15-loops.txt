Loops
	for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
	  // code block to be executed
	}

	expression 1 is used to initialize variables and actually
	allows you to initialize multiple variables just by separating
	it with commas.
	example:
		for (let i = 0, b = 2, ..., n = n; i < 5; i++) {

	Kinds
		for loops through a block of code a number of times
		for/in loops through the properties of an object
		for/of loops through the values of an iterable object
		while loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
		do/while also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

		for
			loops through a block of code a number of times
			
			for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
				text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
			}


		for/in
			loops through the properties of an object

			for (variable in array) {
				// code
			}

			Example:
				const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};
				let text = "";
				for (let x in person) {
				  text += person[x];
				}

		for/of
			loops through the values of an iterable object
			i.e., Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more...

			for (variable of iterable) {
				// code block to be executed
			}

			Example:
				const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];
				let text = "";
				for (let x of cars) {
				  text += x;
				}

		while
			loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

			while (condition) {
				// code block to be executed
			}


		do/while
			also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

			do {
			  // code block to be executed
			}
			while (condition);
