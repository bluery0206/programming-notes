SELECT * FROM tableName;
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;

===========================

SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

===========================

The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
SELECT DISTINCT Syntax 

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers; 

===========================
The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

===========================
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
WHERE Syntax

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

he SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;


The SQL ORDER BY Keyword
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;



How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
IS NOT NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;



The SQL UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;



The SQL SELECT TOP Clause
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;



ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;




The SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

SQL LIKE Examples
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName starting with "a":

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName ending with "a":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "or" in any position:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "r" in the second position:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a ContactName that starts with "a" and ends with "o":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that does NOT start with "a":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';






SQL Wildcard Characters
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

Wildcard Characters in MS Access
Symbol	Description	Example
*	Represents zero or more characters					bl* 		finds bl, black, blue, and blob
?	Represents a single character						h?t 		finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets		h[oa]t 	finds hot and hat, but not hit
!	Represents any character not in the brackets			h[!oa]t 	finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t 	finds cat and cbt
#	Represents any single numeric character				2#5 		finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295
Wildcard Characters in SQL Server
Symbol	Description	Example
%	Represents zero or more characters	bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_	Represents a single character	h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
^	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
All the wildcards can also be used in combinations!

Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:

LIKE Operator	Description
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"





Using the % Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City containing the pattern "es": 

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%';
Using the _ Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "ondon":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any character, followed by "on":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';
Using the [charlist] Wildcard
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';
Using the [!charlist] Wildcard
The two following SQL statements select all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';
Or:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
 
 


IN Operator Examples
The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');




SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;




SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;




BETWEEN with IN Example
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3:

Example
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);





Alias Column Syntax
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;



Alias for Columns Examples
The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:

Example
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):

Example
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;





Alias for Tables Example
The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):

Example
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:

Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;






UPPER()

SELECT *, (SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM Customers) AS Average
FROM Customers 

SELECT city, COUNT(*)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY city
