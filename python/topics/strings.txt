- Multiline string
	""" value """ or ''' value '''

- You can also access each character by specifying the position of the character
		word = "Hello World"

		print(word[0])

	This will print "H"

	Note: String can act as an array, so the index position count starts at 0


	- To get the length of a string (anything it's allowed to really)

			len(value/variable)


	- To check if a part of a string exists within the string

			txt = "The best things in life are free!"
			print("free" in txt)


	- Slicing
		We can limit the access of a string (anything really)

			word = "Arknights"

			print(word[2:4])

		We can also read the line above like this,
		"Say the word but from this letter to that letter only"

		Or

			print(word[2:])

		"Say the word but from this letter to the end of the word"

		Or

			print(word[:2])

		"Say the word but from the beginning to that letter"

		We can also do it in negative numbers but that can be really complicated so no.


	- Modify Strings
		We can also modify string using python

		  word = "Arknights"

		* To make the whole string an uppercase letter

				word.upper()


		* To make the whole string an lowercase letter

				word.lower


		* To remove the whitespace or space in the beginning and at the end of the string

				word.strip()


		* To replace a string/letter with another

				word.replace("A", "O")

			We can read the line above as,
			"In 'word' variable, replace the 'A' with 'O'"


		* We can also split a string turning it into an array

				word = "Arknights_is_my_favorite_game"

				word.split("_")

			We can read the line above as,
			"From the 'word' variable, split the string when '_' is found"

			When that happens, we end up with array containing

				word = ["Arknights", "is", "my", "favorite", "game"]


		* You can also add two strings to together.
			This operation is called contatination or concatinating strings

				a = "Ark"
				b = "nights"
				word = a + b


		* We have variables we can print when we need to.
			But what if we need something more like adding more context to it?
			This is where Formatting Strings come in to play.

				price = 42.40
				formatted_text = f"The total price is {price}"

			The very first "price" is a string and the price variable is placed inside a curly brace is the variable string.
			This way, we can still use the price variable to do more calculations and use the formatted_text variable after the calculation.


			~ Limit decimals shown

					price = 42.40
					formatted_text = f"The total price is {price:.2f}"

			~ We can also do operations inside the bracket. 
				Though I think we will rarely use it so it's just a random fact now.


		* We have symbols we use for coding.
			But what if we use them inside the strings?
			The symbols can be read as symbols for coding in some situations. But to prevent that from happening, we use "Escape Characters" to be able to use these symbols as strings.

				txt = "We are the so-called "Ursus" from the north."

			The code above will not work because the quotation mark from the Ursus cut the whole string into two leaving Ursus outside resulting an error.

			To fix this error, we simply use \ before the symbols

				txt = "We are the so-called \"Ursus\" from the north."

			\\ Escape Characters
				\'	Single Quote	
				\\	Backslash	
				\n	New Line	
				\r	Carriage Return	
				\t	Tab	
				\b	Backspace	
				\f	Form Feed	
				\ooo	Octal value	
				\xhh	Hex value
