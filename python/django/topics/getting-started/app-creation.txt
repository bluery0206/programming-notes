CREATING AN APP
	OPTION 1
		>>> py manage.py startapp APP_NAME
	
	OPTION 2
		>>> django-admin startapp APP_NAME


	> Register the created app. So django knows where to look for templates and more
		on PROJECT_FOLDER/PROJECT_NAME/settings.py
			INSTALLED_APPS = [
				...
				'APP_NAME',
			]

	> Create route for the registered app
		on PROJECT_FOLDER/PROJECT_NAME/urls.py
			from django.urls import include

			urlpatterns = [
				...
				path("", include("APP_NAME.urls")),
				...
			]

	> Create template
		on PROJECT_FOLDER/APP_NAME/templates/APP_NAME/TEMPLATE_NAME.html
			<html>
			<head>
				<title>TITLE</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<h1>Hello World!</h1>
			</body>
			</html>

	> Create view. 
		# This handles some of the back-end logic like validation. 
		# This is also where you connect the template file so that when a view is called, 
		# 	it will show the template you created.
		on PROJECT_FOLDER/APP_NAME/views.py
			from django.shortcuts import render

			def VIEW_NAME(request):
				return render(request, "APP_NAME/TEMPLATE_NAME.html")

	> Create route for the view. This handles what pages to show
		on PROJECT_FOLDER/APP_NAME/urls.py
			import django.urls import path
			from . import views

			urlpatterns = [
				# The first parameter of path() below can be anything, just end it with a backslash (/). 
				# E.g., "home/", "login/", or "profile/username/". 
				# An empty string ("") usually is the page that will load first when you go to 127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser
				path('URL/', views.VIEW_NAME, name="NAME"),
