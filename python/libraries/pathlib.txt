Creating Path Objects:
	Path(path_string)	: Create a path object from a string.
	Path(existing_path)	: Create a path object from an existing path object or file handle.

	name 				: The final component of the path (e.g., "my_file.txt").
	stem				: The name without the extension (e.g., "my_file").
	suffix				: The extension (e.g., ".txt").
	parent				: The parent directory.
	is_file()			: Checks if the path is a file.
	is_dir()			: Checks if the path is a directory.
	exists()			: Checks if the path exists.

Path Operations:
	join(path)			: Joins the path with another path.
	with_name(name)		: Creates a new path with a different name.
	with_suffix(suffix)	: Creates a new path with a different suffix.
	resolve()			: Resolves the path to an absolute path.
	glob(pattern)		: Finds files or directories matching a pattern.
	iterdir()			: Iterates over the contents of a directory.
	mkdir(exist_ok=False)	: Creates a directory.
	rmdir()				: Removes an empty directory.
	unlink()			: Removes a file.
