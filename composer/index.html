Basic Usage
	composer.json
		{
		    "require": {
		        "monolog/monolog": "2.0.*"
		    }
		}

		// "require" tells composer which packages your proeject depends on

		// The naming of packages follows this rule:
			"vendorName/packageName"

	Version Contraints
		2.0.* => all versions within 2.0
		>=2.0 => more latest or 2.0
		<2.1 => older versions


	Installing dependencies
		from composer.json
			>>> composer update

			// This will create the vendor/ dir with files including 
			// the autoloader and a composer.lock just beside the json.

		from composer.lock
			>>> install

	Update
		>>> update
		or
		>>> update vendorName/pkgName [...]

	Packagist.org
		// Like the pypi.org of pip

	Every a project is a package
		composer.json
			{
				...
				"name": "vendorName/pkgName",
				...
			}
