examples:
	show()
	hide()
	rotate(radians) # radiant: double value probably ranging from 0 to 1
	move_local_x() # moves in x axis relative to the postition and angle of the object
	move_local_y()


	# From the tutorial, the object moves after one function called
		example:
			move_forward(80)
			turn_right(80)
			turn_left(80)
	# The object moves forward by the given value then turns degree right then left

	move_forward(pixels) # pixels: int
	turn_right(degrees) # degrees: int, rotates the character by degrees
	turn_left(degrees)

	jump(y, x) # y, x: int 

Naming conventions
	- No spaces 
	- No numbers at the start of the name
	- Start with a letter or underscore


	
Accessing sub-variables with dot
	func run():
		position.x = n
		position.y = n

		scale.x = n
		scale.y = n

down equals postive_y
right equals positive_x
