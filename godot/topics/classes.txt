Classes
	# Nodes are in essence are classes

	Main
		# Scene Tree
			Node2D -> rename: Character

		# Script
			@export var character_to_kill: Character

	Character
		# Script
			class_name RealClassName

			@export var name 	: String
			@export var health 	: int

			func die():
				health = 0
				print(name + " died.")

Inner class
	# Essentially creating a class within a node

	class Equipment:
		var armor 	:= 10
		var weight 	:= 3


	# creates a new instance of the inner class
	var chest		= Equipment.new()
	var leggings	= Equipment.new()


	func _on_ready():
		chest.armor = 30
		print(chest.armor)

Call down signal up / Writing better code
	Using the family abstract:
		A parent can tell his/her children to to things but not vice versa. 
		They can only ask for the parents to act accordingly

	In Godot, A child class should use signals for when something has happened 
	to update neccessary things without making things too complicated.
