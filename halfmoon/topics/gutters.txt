GUTTERS
    Gutters are the padding between your columns, used to responsively space 
        and align content in the grid system.
    Gutters are the gaps between column content, created by horizontal 
        padding. We set padding-right and padding-left on each column, and 
        use negative margin to offset that at the start and end of each row 
        to align content. The class names for setting gutters come in the f
        ollowing formats:
    .g-{size} / .g-{breakpoint}-{size} — sets gutters on all four sides
    .gx-{size} / .gx-{breakpoint}-{size} — sets gutters horizontally
    .gy-{size} / .gy-{breakpoint}-{size} — sets gutters vertically

    
    <div class="container p-4">
        <div class="row gx-3">
            <div class="col"><div class="border">Column</div></div>
            <div class="col"><div class="border">Column</div></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    or

    <div class="row g-N">
       div.col
            div.idk
    </div>
     This ones really complicated though. but I guess with the right structure,
            this will work just like above. It kinda does a css:gap kinda thing
            although it both affects all sides (expt speciffied (gx or gy)).
